Central Africa Standard Time <SQuaicoe1> 'Kidd loves Nengi than Erica' 'Have you seen how he looks at her ass' 'Ozo loves her and not Dorathy' 'Tochi said he would love to date her' 'No guy loves Dora buh they are rushing my babe  Infact all the guys love Dorathy  See your life outside 🤡🤡🤡\n",
      "1304551946741846023 2020-09-11 23:46:36 W. Central Africa Standard Time <orjichiamaka54> See ehh In as much as I want Ozo to leave Nengi and concentrate, Neo is spitting facts, that guy is happy around Nengi, If my baby distant herself it will mess with his head. He has grown use to having her around #bbnaija\n",
      "1304551945630351362 2020-09-11 23:46:35 W. Central Africa Standard Time <zigiluv3> I expected Ozo to know this thing kidd is telling him!! It’s good to be street smart pls!!  #BBNaija\n",
      "1304551941792575489 2020-09-11 23:46:34 W. Central Africa Standard Time <dee__rays> Ozo no dey hear word, he get coconut head\n",
      "1304551938667827200 2020-09-11 23:46:34 W. Central Africa Standard Time <jaznira> Big kindly give Ozo a speaker!!!   Microphone infringement is his only Biggest weakness 😭😭😭 stop blaming Ozo or Nengi. He is not aware on this guys it’s scary. @BBNaija #BBNaija & the first strike he didn’t get because of Nengi. Let’s all put this straight.. pic.twitter.com/JXd4170Gpf\n",
      "1304551938386731008 2020-09-11 23:46:34 W. Central Africa Standard Time <ozzy___> And I’m 100% sure if they woke any of them up and asked who ozo is likely to write a note to everyone knows the answer.\n",
      "1304551931919175680 2020-09-11 23:46:32 W. Central Africa Standard Time <helenwilliamsA2> U are a distraction to Ozo. Ur to Kidwaya I are not better use your head  o\n",

      "1304551924033900546 2020-09-11 23:46:30 W. Central Africa Standard Time <Amani_Boiamani> Whenever Dorathy speaks to Ozo, you could feel the bluntness and honesty from a friend that cares. She hits Ozo real hard with the truth without dragging Nengi or painting her bad.  Dora is one in a million. #BBNaija\n",
      "1304551923790557185 2020-09-11 23:46:30 W. Central Africa Standard Time <queen_TTM> But you guys how do you think Ozo will be without Nengi in this house  #BBNaija\n",
      "1304551911656435713 2020-09-11 23:46:27 W. Central Africa Standard Time <That_IjebuBadoo> Ozo is still one of the most competitive housemates in that house. People still say no matter how much he is with Nengi, he still does tasks very well. All these things don't even count in the final 😂\n",
      "1304551910687617025 2020-09-11 23:46:27 W. Central Africa Standard Time <blessing_ikel> Dora just wasted her  advice on ozo, too bad  #BBNaija\n",

      "1304551889120505857 2020-09-11 23:46:22 W. Central Africa Standard Time <Prex_G> Dora to Ozo, \"You will have feelings for many people, but you just have to know the real one.\"   Please, is this the first time Ozo is falling in love? Why will you meet a girl in less than three months and lost your senses and focus?  #BBNaija #BBNaijialockdown2020\n",
      "1304551882208276484 2020-09-11 23:46:20 W. Central Africa Standard Time <busolaidowu> Neo feels this is Ozo's personality and if she stops him from showing love as he knows how to, Ozo will not be himself.\n",
      "1304551879033204743 2020-09-11 23:46:20 W. Central Africa Standard Time <AmazingElena4> Dorathy to Ozo: I always tell you, heads in the game #BBNaija pic.twitter.com/36JrIKsuDE\n",

      "1304551875069587456 2020-09-11 23:46:19 W. Central Africa Standard Time <ISTANELO> Basically telling Nengi that they shouldn't just switch off . That Ozo is just being himself, in as much as he get Nengi's view that there people that 'll relate with this side of Ozo. Many yarns shaa😁\n",
